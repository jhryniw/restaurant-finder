Assignment 2: Restaurant part A

# Restaurant Finder
A program for finding restaurants in Edmonton

Accessories:
  * 1x Arduino MEGA board
  * 1x Adafruit ILI9341 Breakout Board
  * 1x SainSmart JoyStick Module
  * 1x SD card containing "yeg-big.lcd" file with map of Edmonton

Wiring instructions:
  Adafruit:
    (Left is Adafruit, right is Arduino)
    * GND   <>  GND
    * Vin   <>  5V
    * CLK   <>  52
    * MISO  <>  50
    * MOSI  <>  51
    * CS    <>  10
    * D/C   <>  9
    * Y+    <>  A2
    * X+    <>  4
    * Y-    <>  5
    * X-    <>  A3
    * CCS   <>  6

  Note: Make sure the SD card is properly inserted in the Adafruit display

  Joystick:
    (Left is joystick, right is Arduino)
    * GND   <>  GND
    * +5V   <>  5V
    * VRx   <>  A1
    * VRy   <>  A0
    * SW    <>  2

Program instructions:
  * Wire Arduino as above and connect it to the computer.
  * In terminal, navigate to program directory and enter "make upload".
    To check if SD card is connected, also enter "serial-mon".
  * The joystick controls the cursor; the farther it is pressed, the
    faster the cursor moves.
  * Moving the cursor to the edge of the displayed map (not including
    the black bar) will move the map in that direction.
	* Clicking the joystick in map mode will list the closest 30 restaurants
		from the cursor.
	* Selecting a restaurant in list mode then clicking the cursor will center
		the cursor and map on the selection.
  * Touching the ratings bar on the right hand of the screen will allow you to
    select the minimum rating of the restaurants displayed when you select a
    location. Restaurants are rated from 1-5 with 5 being the highest
     * The lowest rating circle filled in white indicates the minimum rating.

Notes:
  * The program assumes that the joysticks are calibrated similarly.
    If they are not, the cursor will move by itself.
